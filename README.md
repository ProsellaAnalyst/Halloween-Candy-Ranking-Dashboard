## Bussiness Problem

Retailers often struggle to predict which Halloween candies will sell best, risking lost revenue or excess inventory. This interactive Power BI dashboard ranks candies by popularity, analyzing sugar content, price tier, and consumer preference. It provides actionable insights to optimize stocking, pricing, and marketing strategies during the Halloween season.


## 🧠 Key Insights  

- **Peanut M&M’s** stands out as the *top performer*, combining **high sugar content**, a **medium price tier**, and the **highest overall win percentage (6 feature counts)** — demonstrating that affordability and balanced sweetness correlate strongly with popularity.  
- **Candy Corn**, despite its **high sugar percentage**, performs relatively poorly in overall ranking — suggesting that **excessive sweetness** does not directly translate to consumer preference.  
- **Nik-L-Nip**, positioned within a **high price tier**, records the **lowest win percentage**, reinforcing the idea that **price sensitivity** plays a major role in candy popularity during seasonal events like Halloween.  
- **100 Grand** emerges as an **interesting outlier** — it carries the **highest price tier**, yet still achieves a **solid 66.97% win rate**, highlighting a niche appeal despite premium pricing.  
- **One Quarter** exhibits the **lowest sugar content (0.01%)** and a **46.12% win rate**, indicating a moderate preference for candies with minimal sugar levels among certain demographics.  
- **Skittles** shows a balance of **low price tier**, **high sugar percentage**, and **high win rate**, reflecting its accessibility and broad consumer reach — though it also raises questions about health perception versus appeal.  

These findings illustrate how **price, taste, and brand familiarity** collectively influence consumer decisions more than sugar content alone.
